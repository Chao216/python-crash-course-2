***AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON***

## 1. join list of strings use following syntax
```python
str1 = ", " # could be anything for seperation purpose

longString = str1.join(list1) # you can also use join with tuple, set, dictionary

# you don't have to pre-define a spe string

longString1 = ' # '.join(tuple1) # you can write the sep string right before .join()
```
